PURPOSE OF PROJECT: design a free program to manage passwords
DATE: 22 February 2018
AUTHOR: Danylo Mirin

POTENTIAL TOPICS:
    - Percolation w/ reading colors --> IRL applications?
    - Server side stuff (Have a program connect, read, analyze, write to site)
        - Maybe an IMS
        - Built-in encryption based on what I already have
    - Menus (finish the Encryptor's menu)
        - Could be merged together with the JAR working thing
    - JAR files (Make a menu jar file that can work with other jars)

STATUS:
- Encryption works!
- Error Logging works!
- Password managment works!
